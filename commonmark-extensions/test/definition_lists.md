## Definition lists

The term is given on a line by itself, followed by
one or more definitions. Each definition must begin
with `:` (after 0-2 spaces); subsequent lines must
be indented unless they are lazy paragraph
continuations.

The list is tight if there is no blank line between
the term and the first definition, otherwise loose.
